    "### Dataset: Microcredit in Morocco\n",
    "This tutorial uses a microcredit program dataset from a randomized experiment conducted in rural Moroccan villages in 2006 (Cr√©pon et al., 2015). To understand the impact of microcredit availability, certain villages (treatment group) were given access to microcredit and the amount of loans taken at the household level, was measured in relation to the control group, as an indication of the demand for microcredits. There are observable characteristics for each household, and it is possible to condition on these covariates to discover heterogeneity in the causal effect of microcredit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a preprint released earlier this month through the Social Science Research Network (SSRN), Daniel Jacob surveys the machine learning methods available for estimating CATE, using among others, the Moroccan microcredit dataset as an example. Jacob explains that the goal is to find subgroups based on the covariates, where the treatment effect will be different; however, we do not know which subgroups to focus on and there are many covariates, so machine learning is required to estimate the CATE. The following section covers causal inference and the potential outcomes framework to explain how the CATE is calculated."
